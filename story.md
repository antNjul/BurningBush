#Burning Bush - Our Story
Burning Bush is a Christian books and eBooks publishing company based in Mumbai, India. We at Burning Bush are committed to providing this platform to both, the established and the first-time authors, who have transformational and inspirational content to share on Christian faith.  We aim to have a maximum reach with these contents, into people’s homes and devices.

##Burning Bush is led by its co-founders, Julie Anthony and Anthony Xavier, who formed the company in 2020 with the aim of promoting Christian value and wisdom books.

```
It was Anthony who was inspired by Moses’s Burning Bush encounter with God in the Bible _[Exodus 3:1-6]_. Just as the burning bush had got Moses’ attention and aroused curiosity in him, which enabled God to start a conversation and a relationship with him, Anthony too was motivated to start a publishing firm and name it as Burning Bush; he envisioned it as catering to authors, writing Christian books.

`Burning Bush is underpinned by following **three** principles:`

|Faith | Love | Renewal

|Faith in God – his promises and his faithfulness.| Love for a fellow reader, we intend to start a Gift-it-Forward plan that would enable many to read books for free as it was paid for them already.|With our personal experiences in the renewal, we look forward to promoting renewal of minds and transformation of lives through our content. |
