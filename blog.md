#Encounter

##When Moses saw the burning bush, why did he get curious? What made him approach the burning bush? In the Bible, we read, the bush was burning far on the mountain. Moses saw the bush burning and approached it to investigate. I feel that the bush could have been burning for a longer time and Moses could have seen it much earlier and ignored it assuming it to be the result of travelers or shepherds cooking their food or keeping themselves warm or to ward off dangerous animals. 
 
```So then what made him change his mind? why did he get intrigued and set out to explore? 
Though these presumptions could have been the initial reasons for his delay to investigate – this delay could have been of few days or few weeks! What fascinated him was that the bush continued to burn with same intensity, and if had been man-made then it should have got extinguished days ago and if it had been work of nature then it should have by now burnt that part of the mountain! Nothing of that happened. In fact, he noticed that the burning bush would burn at a same intensity – irrespective of the direction of the winds and would ever seem to spread for days. He realizes that this fire was different, this knowledge was enough to inspire his curiosity to seek answers to all the questions and doubts forming in his mind. 
```

*Moses* reaches the spot of the burning bush and sees a series of unusual phenomenon; he first saw the angel of the Lord appear to him in flames of fire within the bush; the bush though on fire did not burn! He tries getting closer to have a better look when suddenly he hears a voice coming from within the bush, calling out his name! What just happened is, Moses encountered God, his response enabled God to initiate a relationship with him. Moses turned out to be a great prophet of God. He was chosen to bring God’s chosen people out of slavery and out of Egypt, into the land, Lord had promised his ancestors – the land of and for Israel. 


Likewise, we all have our burning bush moments that may have turned our lives 180 degrees, not one person is left untouched when God reaches out. I can share many such burning bush moments in the lives of great and simple. Let’s look at the example of Mother Teresa. 

Mother took her solemn vows in May 1937, while she was a teacher at the Loreto Convent school in Entally, in east Calcutta. She served there for nearly twenty years and was appointed as its headmistress in 1944. Although, Mother enjoyed teaching at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in Calcutta. And during one of her visits to Darjeeling by train, she heard the call of her inner conscious. She felt that she should serve the poor by staying with them. It took Mother Teresa, twenty years to accept her call for serving the poor.
 
God looks to give us powerful encounters that could dramatically transform our life's journey. However, we need to be sensitive to His presence and listen to his still, small voice.
 
God can speak to you, too—near a cooker, a computer, a mop, a canvas, a keyboard, a microphone, an exercise machine, or in any other place. 
 
Let me demonstrate with a true story: Br. Alan, who is studying for becoming a Catholic Priest was working as a software engineer for a very large and reputed company and he was chosen to fly to USA for a very important project. Days before leaving, he had his burning bush moment where the Lord spoke to him and he left his job to later join the seminary. He also went on to write a book on the topic of rosary called Rosary: Is this prayer biblical?
 
In the closing, I’d like to share my burning bush encounter  that I experienced when I accidentally attended a Book Fair in London, in the year 2007; instantly I knew it and  told myself that I will start a publishing house someday. It took me 14 years and finally in October of 2020, the Burning Bush Publishing was established. 

God waits to speak to you in your daily routine. Keep him close through prayers and reading his word daily, then Listen, look for, and find God anew and experience your burning bush moment. Amen. 

God Bless you!!
